I am Software Engineer, currently working as a Member of Technical Staff at Salesforce. I have 2 years of experience working in the software industry which has been an amazing journey so far. I am learning about Architecture, Design Principles, Refactoring, and Testing in different quadrants in a fast pace work, where product delivery is time-boxed.
I worked with a start-up during my internship period, in which I developed an application to extract information from a handwritten prescription.</description></item><item><title>Glasses</title><link>https://mianto.github.io/projects/glasses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mianto.github.io/projects/glasses/</guid><description>A web application to detect whether the user is wearing glasses or not.
