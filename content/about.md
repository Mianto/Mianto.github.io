I'm a Software Engineer with approximately three years of experience in the dynamic world of software development. I've had the privilege of honing my skills in a range of programming languages, fostering a knack for designing and implementing intricate, reliable, and efficient software solutions. Through my journey, I've embraced software development best practices, finding my stride in diverse product-based companies that thrive on Agile methodologies and fast-paced environments. My expertise spans Unit and Integration testing, along with a mastery of crafting comprehensive test plans to ensure both code quality and adherence to project requirements.

Education has been a cornerstone of my growth. I pursued a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. This experience instilled in me a sense of resilience and the ability to thrive when faced with challenges. My academic background has provided a robust foundation in computer science, equipping me with the skills needed to navigate complex software development landscapes.

My proficiency extends to programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, accompanied by hands-on familiarity with an array of frameworks and tools. During a valuable internship with a start-up, I had the privilege of orchestrating an end-to-end MVP product, involving the extraction of handwritten prescription information through HP printers and the Google Vision API.

Presently, I'm fortunate to contribute as a Member of Technical Staff at Salesforce. Here, I'm dedicated to an ongoing journey of knowledge expansion and skill refinement. My commitment involves embracing architectural and design principles, as well as employing testing techniques across project quadrants. All of this, while adhering to demanding timelines to ensure timely product delivery.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I'm deeply passionate about learning and personal development. You might find me engrossed in TV shows, sketching away on paper, or tuned into insightful podcasts. This eclectic mix feeds into my hunger for knowledge, whether it's about coding, finance, or other areas that fuel my personal and professional growth.

In summary, I bring my experience, humility, and an insatiable appetite for improvement to the realm of software development. I'm honored to be on this journey of growth, and I am excited about the prospect of contributing to diverse and dynamic software teams.
