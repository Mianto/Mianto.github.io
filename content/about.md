Hey there !!

I am Software Engineer, currently working as a Member of Technical Staff at Salesforce. I have 2 years of experience working in the software industry which has been an amazing journey so far. I am learning about Architecture, Design Principles, Refactoring, and Testing in different quadrants in a fast pace work, where product delivery is time-boxed.

I worked with a start-up during my internship period, in which I developed an application to extract information from a handwritten prescription. I made an end-to-end MVP product using the HP printers using their SDK, taking scanned images and parsing them by using Google Vision API.

In my free time, I like to watch TV shows, draw and paint, and listen to various podcasts ranging from investing, coding, finance, etc.
