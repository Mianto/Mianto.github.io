Hey there !!

I am Software Engineer, currently working as Member of Technical Staff at Salesforce. I have 2 years of experience of working with software industry which has been amazing journey so far. I am learning about the Architecture, Design Principles, Refactoring and Testing in different quadrants in a fast pace work, where product delivery is time boxed.

I have worked with an start-up during my internship period, in which I have developed application to extract information from a hand written prescription. I made an end-to-end MVP product using the HP printers using their sdk, taking scanned images and parsing them by using Google Vision API.


<!-- I am an open-source _enthusiast_ (focussing on enthusiast) because I haven't been able to contribute much.  I will definitely try to dedicate more time towards open source in coming months. -->

In my free time, I like to watch TV shows, draw and paint, and listen to various podcasts ranging from investing, coding, finance etc.
