I am a results-driven Software Engineer with approximately three years of experience in the software development industry. I possess an extensive range of programming skills and am adept at designing and implementing complex, reliable, efficient, and maintainable software solutions. My expertise in software development best practices has enabled me to operate effectively in a variety of product-based companies, employing Agile methodologies and working within fast-paced environments. I am a proficient Unit and Integration tester and possess advanced skills in the design and execution of comprehensive test plans to ensure code quality and project requirement compliance.

I completed my Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, which has taught me resilience and the ability to thrive under pressure. My educational background has provided me with a solid foundation in computer science and has equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle complex software development challenges.

I am skilled in programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, and have experience working with a variety of frameworks and tools. Additionally, I possess practical experience through an internship with a start-up company, where I developed an end-to-end MVP product that involved extracting handwritten prescription information. This involved using HP printers and the Google Vision API.

As a Member of Technical Staff at Salesforce, I remain dedicated to continuously expanding my knowledge and improving my skillset. I am committed to learning about and applying architectural, design principles, refactoring, and testing techniques in various project quadrants, all while working under stringent time constraints to ensure timely product delivery.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I maintain a strong passion for learning and personal development. I enjoy watching TV shows, drawing and painting, and listening to various podcasts that help enhance my knowledge and skills, particularly those related to investing, coding, finance, and other topics that are relevant to my professional and personal growth.

Overall, my extensive experience, passion for technology, and dedication to personal and professional development make me a valuable asset to any software development team.
