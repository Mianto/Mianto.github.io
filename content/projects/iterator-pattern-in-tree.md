Iterator Pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements, without knowing it's inner implementations.

Using the design pattern, the following traversal hass been implemented

* Preorder traversal
* Inorder traversal
* Postorder traversal
* Breadth First traversal
